              I graduated from Les Cour Sonou University, Cotonou, Benin

              I am an inventive, Result-driven and focused Frontend Engineer. I
              am skilled in designing and developing multiple web-based
              applications incorporating a range of technologies. I have used my
              passion for solving problems and assisting people and businesses
              in accomplishing their objectives by making users lives better by
              bringing designs to life through the development process with my
              code. I firmly believe in taking a collaborative approach to each
              project. I enjoy solving users problems, and I love working with a
              team to achieve a common goal.

              I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy. I

              and that&#39;s what I strive to do, I have a passion for
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and am
              always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
